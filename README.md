## ðŸ’» About me
I'm a tinkerer who loves to try new technologies and applies them to real life problems. My background is in Robotics and Computer Vision but I also enjoy game development and interactive installation technologies such as projection mapping. I enjoy writing, and so I decided to start [**blogging**](https://dailytinkerer.blogspot.com/). I dont consider myself a programmer or software engineer because I lack the discipline to rigorously write beautiful code, but I see myself more of a prototyper or technology enthusiast.

ðŸŽ¾ Other than technology, I enjoy tennis, swimming and badminton. Nothing refreshes me more than a good workout after long hours of coding.

ðŸŽ¥ I enjoy movies especially science fiction and Star Trek is a big favorite.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working to bring ![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/machine-learning-brightgreen) to solve various business problems. I focus more on Computer Vision related issues but also sometimes dive into various other fields such as data analysis.
